# ![Onedata](doc/img/heading.png) Documentation
Onedata is a global data management system, providing easy access to distributed storage resources, supporting wide range of use cases from personal data management to data-intensive scientific computations.

With Onedata, users can access, store, process and publish data using global data storage backed by computing centers and storage providers worldwide.

Onedata focuses on instant, transparent access to distributed data sets, without unnecessary staging and migration, allowing access to the data directly from your local computer or worker node.

If this is your first encounter with Onedata, start with the overview of major concepts of the platform to get familiar with the overall architecture and basic aspects of the system such as spaces, clients and providers.
