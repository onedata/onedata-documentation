# ![Onedata](doc/img/heading.png) Documentation
Onedata is a global data management system, providing easy access to distributed storage resources, supporting wide range of use cases from personal data management to data-intensive scientific computations.

For quick overview of basic concepts and functionality check out our [Getting started](doc/getting_started/what_is_onedata.md) section.

#### For users
Learn how to access, manage and share your data. Create groups of users with fine grained access rights. Share and collaborate on your data.

Read the Onedata [User quickstart](doc/getting_started/user_onedata_101.md) and follow the [User guide](doc/user_guide.md).


#### For administrators
