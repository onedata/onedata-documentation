## Space storage support token
For maximum ease of use for users as well as flexibility, the storage support requests have a form of unique authornization tokens, which have to be generated by users in Onezone web interface and sent to the storage providers from which they would like to request storage space.

Tokens have a form of strings, e.g.:
