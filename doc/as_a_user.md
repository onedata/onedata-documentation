# User Quickstart
This step-by-step guide shows how to create a Onedata account, support your default space and upload files to your account.

## Set up an account
1. Go to [Onedata login page](https://onedata.org/login) and sign in using one of the supported login methods.
2. Follow the instructions presented to you at first login.
3. You will see the *Manage account* page, were you can edit your account details.

For more information about different ways of authenticating with Onedata, see [Authentication](solutions/authentication.md).
For more information about managing your account, see [Account management](account_management.md).

## Supporting the Default Space
At the first login, a **default space** is created for you.
Like every space, at the beginning it has quota size of 0MB. You have to request storage support with certain limit (e.g. 5GB) from some provider to be able to store any files in this space.

At the bottom of the *Manage account* page you can find the storage support request **token**. You need to send this token to one of storage providers who use Onedata and ask to support your space.

After having your space supported by at least 1 provider, press *Click here to check again* link. Click on the button "Go to your files". You will be redirected to Onedata [web interface](user_guide.md), where you can manage your files and [more](user_guide.md).

## Uploading file
1. Click the **Upload file** button - which is the second icon from the left located just above the *spaces* directory.
2. Click the **Select files** and using the system dialog select files you wish to upload. You can select multiple files.
3. Click the **Start upload** button in order to start the upload.
4. Observe the *progress bars*. The first one tracks the overall progress of the upload, the second tracks the progress of the file being uploaded.

## Next steps
After you are comfortable using basic file operations in your default space, see the [User Guide](user_guide.md) and learn how to work with multiple spaces and perform some more advanced actions.
