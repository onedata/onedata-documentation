# Administrator quick start
Currently Onedata services deployment is possible using our Docker images
available at [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/u/onedata/). The following
guide covers only the shortest deployment path based on Docker images. For more options see

The machines which will run the onedata services should fullfil these [requirements](../system_requirements.md).
