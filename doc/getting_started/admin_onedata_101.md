# Administrator quick start
Currently Onedata services deployment is possible using our Docker images
available at [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/u/onedata/).

Detailed explanation and examples on using these images can be found at the
official [Onedata Getting Started repository](https://github.com/onedata/getting-started).

The Getting Started tutorial provides several scenarios with varying degrees
of complexity for setting up a Onedata deployment.

For in-depth administrator tutorial on how to deploy Onedata services in production see [here](../administering_onedata/deployment_tutorial.md).
