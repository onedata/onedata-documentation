# Quickstart

To help you get up to speed with Onedata we provide a number of tutorials that allow you to deploy your own complete Onedata installation or just Oneprovider environment and become a part of Onedata worldwide ecosystem. 

Scenarios vary in complexity (&#x1F4D7; easy,  &#x1F4D8; medium, &#x1F4D5; hard) and requirments (&#x1F30D; public ip required).

With these tutorials you can learn how to easily setup your own oneprovider and register it with [onedata.org]():

- &#x1F4D7; &#x1F30D; [public provider single-node](): single node oneprovider
- &#x1F4D8; &#x1F30D; [public provider multi-node](): double node oneprovider

If you don't have a public ip, or you want to test a fully functional, isolated Onedata installation:

- &#x1F4D8; [onedata single-node](): node onezone and single node oneprovider
- &#x1F4D8; [onedata multi-node](): double node onezone and double node oneprovider
- &#x1F4D5; [customized onedata multi-node](): double node onezone and double node oneprovider - needs configuration using a wizzard
