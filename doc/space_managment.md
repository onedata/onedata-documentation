## Introduction to spaces
<img style="float:right;margin: 00px 30px" src="img/spaces/1_space_with_files.png">
You can think of a space as a virtual directory, with its storage capacity limited by a quota. A space serves as a root directory for all your files and directories located in that space.
You can create multiple spaces, each govern by separate quota.

### Default Space
<img style="float:right;margin: 0px 0px" src="img/spaces/default_space_with_files_and_user.png">
Upon account creation a first space is created which is marked as a *default space*.
The content of the default space is presented as a content of a root directory of your files. In the default space resides a single directory called `spaces`, which allows you to access files in other no-default spaces.

### Work with multiple spaces
To understand the hierarchy of spaces, lets go through an example:
- we have 3 spaces
- in each space there are a directory and a file which name corresponds to the space's name


In first case the Space1 is designated as a default space. Two other spaces were put into folder `spaces` and can be accessed form the default space.

Lets change the default space to Space2. Now when you will accesss your files, at the root level you will see the content of Space2. In order to access the content of Space1 you will have to navigate to `spaces/Space1`.

## Manage your spaces
You can manage your spaces form the **Manage spaces** page. To navigate to Manage spaces page, click on the **Spaces** in the Onedata Web Interface, there you can see the list of all your spaces with one of them described as a default space.

### Create your space
The first space is created for you during the first login. In order to create more spaces:

1. In the Onedata Web Interface click **Spaces** button located on the top menu.
2. On the **Manage spaces** page, click **Create new space** button.
3. On the bottom of the screen set the name of the new space and click **OK** button.

New space will appear on the list of spaces designated with a unique ID.

### Space Properties
On the **Manage spaces** page, you can see a detailed information about a space by clicking on it.

All information regarding you space is presented here, including:

- a list of providers who support

For more information about groups, see [Group Management](group_management.md).
