# Space Collaboration


You can give other users or groups access to your space by adding them to your space. The level of access a user or a group has, depends on which permissions you choose to grant them.

For more details on permissions, see [Space Management](space_management.md) page.

## Invite another user to your space
To share a space with another user:

1. Navigate to **Spaces** page.
2. On your space, click the **Settings** button.
3. Pick **Invite User** from the drop down menu.
4. Copy the token and send it to the user you wish to share your space with.

After another user joins your space you will be able to see him in the detailed space view.


## Join another user's space
