## Backing up

If the standard installation procedure was followed, all data essential for 
the Onezone service is placed in a single, self-contained directory 
(`/opt/onedata/onezone`). This directory is sufficient to restore the 
service or migrate it to another host. It contains the configuration for 
running the docker container as well as the persistence directory which 
contains database files and service configuration. **Backing up the service
boils down to creating snapshots of the installation directory.**

> **NOTE:** Apart from the Onezone service persistence that stores file
> metadata, administrators should back up the underlying storage systems 
> that store the physical data exposed via logical Onedata spaces. This guide
> does not cover storage data backups, please use backup procedures recommended

Below are examples how [offline](#offline-backups) and [live](#live-backups) 
backups can be performed. 

### Offline backups

Offline backups guarantee the complete integrity of the snapshot, but require 
a certain downtime of the service. If downtimes are acceptable, one can 
configure a periodic procedure that is run during low usage periods, e.g. at night.

1. Stop the service.
```bash
sudo systemctl stop onezone
```
2. Backup the installation directory to a tar file.
```bash
tar zcPf /opt/onedata/onezone /mybackups/onezone.tgz
```
3. Start the service.
```bash
sudo systemctl start onezone
```
4. Copy the snapshot to a safe place, preferably multiple locations that use 
different underlying storage infrastructures to achieve backup redundancy.
```bash
scp /mybackups/onezone.tgz some.remote.server:/backups/onezone.tgz
```

> **NOTE:** Tools such as rsync can be used to speed up the backups and limit
> the downtimes, by doing fast incremental copies, e.g.:
```bash
sudo systemctl stop onezone
rsync -a /opt/onedata/onezone /mybackups/onezone-backup
sudo systemctl start onezone
# compress and store the /mybackups/onezone-backup directory
# while the service is already back online
```

> **NOTE:** In multinode deployments, the procedure must be done on each host
> and synchronized, i.e. all nodes should be stopped, then backed up and started
> together.


### Live backups

The script
[odbackup.sh](https://github.com/onedata/onedata-deployments/blob/master/bin/odbackup.sh)
from
[onedata-deployments](https://github.com/onedata/onedata-deployments)
repository can be used to automate the backup process. It is
particularly useful for multinode onedata deployments â€“ see the
`README.md` for usage details. In this procedure, the service nodes
are not stopped, but the snapshot is performed as much in parallel as
possible. Despite using LVM's atomic snapshots, this approach does not
guarantee complete integrity of the backups, as in rare cases the
backup may happen when application's state is not fully flushed from
memory to the disk. Nevertheless, the possible data loss caused by
live backups is marginal as service restoration / disaster recovery
typically uses a backup from several hours or days before an incident.
There is an ongoing effort to support live backups with guaranteed
data consistency.


## Restoring

### Preparation of Virtual Machines 

Some disaster recovery scenarios require creation of new VMs to
restore the service.  The [ansible
playbook](https://github.com/onedata/onedata-deployments/tree/master/ansible)
from
[onedata-deployments](https://github.com/onedata/onedata-deployments)
repository can be used to speed up the process. Alternatively, one can
manually run the commands included in the
[Installation](installation.md) section.

Ideally, the new VMs should have the same IP addresses and hostnames
as the original ones. If that is not possible, additional steps will
be needed after the restoring to bring up the Couchbase database that
depends on the IP addresses in its cluster configuration. In this
case, refer to the official documentation on how to set up a Couchbase
cluster.


### Restoring from backup

Run the following procedure on the VM designated to host the restored service:

1. Copy the tar file of the last backup.
```
scp some.remote.server:/backups/onezone.tgz /mybackups/onezone.tgz
```
2. Restore the installation directory from the tar file.
```
tar zxPf /mybackups/onezone.tgz
```
3. Start the service.
```
sudo systemctl start onezone
```

> **NOTE:** If the service is started on another VM, it must be assigned the 
> relevant public IP.

> **NOTE:** In multinode deployments, the procedure must be done on each host
> and the nodes should be started together.
