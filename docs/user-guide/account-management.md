## Connecting additional accounts

If your Onezone service supports multiple OpenID Identity Providers, you have
the option to connect multiple external accounts to a single Onedata account.
This allows you to log in using various accounts such as Google, Facebook,
and GitHub, all under the same Onedata account.

To connect additional accounts, follow these steps:

1. Click on **Add account** button.
2. Choose your identity provider.
3. Follow the steps on your identity provider's page.
