## Setting user username
To enhance your Onedata service experience and facilitate collaboration with other users,
it is recommended to set a username for your account after the initial sign-in.

By setting a username, other users can easily find and collaborate with you, such as inviting you to join spaces or groups.

To set your username, follow these instructions:
1. Sign in to your Onedata account.
2. Locate the username.
3. Enter your desired username.

## Connecting additional accounts
If your Onezone service supports multiple OpenID Identity Providers, you have the option to connect multiple external accounts to a single Onedata account. This allows you to log in using various accounts such as Google, Facebook, and GitHub, all under the same Onedata account.

To connect additional accounts, follow these steps:
1. Access your Onezone service.
2. Look for the linked accounts feature.

## User ID
To locate your user ID:

1. Go to the user profile page.
