# Datasets

[toc][]

## Overview

Datasets are essentially files or directories that have been marked by space users as
representing data collections relevant to them. They can be used to organize data in
a space systematically.

Datasets offer additional features, compared to regular files and directories:

* optional [data and metadata write protection][protection],
* [dataset structure][hierarchy] tracking using the [dataset browser][Datasets, Archives tab],
* ability to [create persistent snapshots][create archive] of the physical dataset
  contents ‚Äî [archives][].

Datasets can be nested, allowing users to compose arbitrary [hierarchical][hierarchy]
structures.

![dataset-hierarchy][]

The diagram above shows the filesystem tree, where some directories are marked as
datasets (*Experiment A* and *Results*). Regular files also can be marked as datasets
(*Statistics.csv*). The file or directory is marked as a dataset by
[establishing][establishing datasets] the datasets on it.

## Establishing datasets

To establish a dataset, navigate to the [file browser][], open the context for a file or
directory, and choose **Datasets**.

![screen-file-menu-datasets][]

You will see a right-side dataset panel for the selected file or directory.

![screen-panel-establish-dataset][]

In this example, the selected directory has no dataset established. Click on the
**Establish dataset** button in the center of the panel to create a dataset.

The panel should now present a summary of the dataset established on the selected
directory.

![screen-dataset-established-status][]

## Datasets hierarchy

Datasets can be established on files or directories lying inside other datasets. This way,
a **hierarchy** of datasets can be built and then embraced to create [nested archives][].

Navigate inside a directory with dataset established and open the **Datasets** panel for
selected file or directory. The panel will show the existing hierarchy of the ancestor
datasets. You can establish a nested dataset using the **Establish** button placed above
the ancestor table.

![screen-before-establishing-nested][]

## File browser datasets panel

The **Datasets** panel for a file or directory presents information about the dataset
established on the file/directory and its optional dataset ancestors. The view consists
of:

* **Settings** tab ‚Äî containing dataset status and [actions][dataset actions], dataset
  [hierarchy][] table with write [protection][] configuration,
* **Archives** tab ‚Äî containing dataset snapshots ([archives][]) browser,
* **write protection badges** in the header ‚Äî showing the effective write [protection][]
  of the selected file or directory,
* **Show in dataset browser** button in the footer ‚Äî navigating to [Datasets,
  Archives tab][] within the space, with a focus on the selected dataset.

![screen-datasets-panel][]

### Dataset actions

You can perform various actions on the established dataset:

![screen-dataset-actions][]

* **Copy ID** ‚Äî copy the dataset ID into the clipboard,
* **Create archive** ‚Äî [create snapshot][create archive] of the dataset (an
  [archive][archives]),
* **Detach** ‚Äî set dataset to [detached][detaching datasets] state,
* **Remove** ‚Äî [remove][removing datasets] the dataset feature from the file or directory.

If the dataset is already in the [detached][detaching datasets] state, the **Detach**
action becomes a **Re-attach** action which changes the dataset's state to **attached**.

### Dataset hierarchy table

The dataset hierarchy table shows a list of the ancestor directories having datasets
established (and not [detached][detaching datasets]). The first row of the table shows a
summary of the **ancestor datasets** ‚Äî you can click on it to show or hide the list. If
there are any ancestors, the **Data/Metadata write protection** columns for the first row,
show effective [protection][] status inherited from the ancestors.

![screen-protection-inherited][]

Rows for the ancestors contain links to the directories with datasets established and
allow configuring the protection of each. The last row of the table shows information
about the dataset established on the current file or directory and allows configuring the
direct protection of this datasets.

::: tip NOTE
File's or directory's **effective** protection is presented using the badges at
the upper-right side of the panel ‚Äî it is a result of the ancestors and direct
protection sum.

### Archives tab

The archives tab label displays the current number of snapshots created from the selected
dataset. Inside the tab, you will find an [archives list][] for the dataset ‚Äî explained in
detail in the [archives][]' documentation.

![screen-archives-tab][]

## Data and metadata write protection

The lifecycle of a dataset can look like the following:

* acquisition ‚Äî creating and collecting,
* consolidation and aggregation,
* processing/analysis,
* annotation,
* publishing/sharing,
* archiving.

Quite often, there is a need to apply certain procedures at different stages of data
curation. For example, at the annotation stage, the dataset managers may wish to freeze
its contents from further modifications. Similarly, at the publishing stage, the authors
may wish to disable further changes to the annotated metadata ‚Äî especially if the dataset
has been assigned a persistent identifier and referenced in scientific works.

To prevent changes in the dataset, users can set temporary **protection** flags, which
cause the files and directories in the dataset to be protected from, accordingly:

* **Data protection** ‚Äî modifying their content or being deleted,
* **Metadata protection** ‚Äî modifying their metadata, such as custom JSON/RDF/extended
  attributes metadata, permissions, or ACLs.

The protection flags are inherited by children datasets ‚Äî datasets lower in the
[hierarchy][] tree have protection at least as strong as their ancestors.

You can modify protection flags in the [dataset hierarchy table][] of the file or
directory datasets panel. When the file or directory has the protection enabled, the
**Datasets** badge for the file has additional icons representing the applied protection.

The following screenshot presents data and metadata protection set on the **FirstDataset**
directory, which makes impossible to rename files inside.

## Creating snapshots ‚Äî archives

A snapshot of a dataset created at a certain point in time is called an
[archive][archives].

Archives are immutable and stored within a space, lying in a special directory detached
from the regular file tree. They can be accessed using the specialized browser of
datasets and archives.

You can create archives using the **Create archive** [action][dataset actions] or in the
archives tab of the [file browser datasets panel][].

See [this][archives] chapter for more details.

## Detaching datasets

Datasets that are no longer needed (from the space data point of view) can be **detached**.
A detached dataset is decoupled from its root file/directory and serves only archival
purposes. **All the archives created from the dataset are retained.** The dataset does not
correspond to any physical content in the space file tree, but it shows up in the dataset
browser.

The dataset is also automatically detached when the corresponding file or directory is
deleted.

If the original file/directory is not deleted, the dataset can be later **re-attached**.
This can be done using the **Re-attach** action in the [dataset actions][].

## Removing datasets

Removing a dataset is essentially disabling the dataset-related features for a file or
directory, leaving the data untouched. The dataset also disappears from the [dataset
tree][hierarchy].

While detaching a dataset is not a harmful operation from the archive's perspective,
deleting the entire dataset is, so **the dataset cannot be removed until it has any
archives**.

For more information about deleting archives, refer to [this page][deleting archives].

You can remove a dataset without an archive, using the **Remove** action in the [dataset
actions][].
