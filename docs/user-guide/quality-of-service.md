<!-- @TODO VFS-7218 missing chapter -->

<!-- TODO VFS-6815
    * QoS chapter should be divided into 2 separate chapters: for admins and users.
      Chapter for admins should have links to the users' chapter.
    * After dividing the chapter, update link in storage-backends.md#qos-parameters to point to
