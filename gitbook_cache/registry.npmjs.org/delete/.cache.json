they exist (sync and async).\n\n## Install\n\nInstall with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/):\n\n```sh\n$ npm install --save delete\n```\n\n## Usage\n\n```js\nvar del = require('delete');\n\n// async\ndel(['foo/*.js'], function(err, deleted) {\n  if (err) throw err;\n  // deleted files\n  console.log(deleted);\n});\n\n// sync\ndel.sync(['foo/*.js']);\n\n// promise\ndel.promise(['foo/*.js'])\n  .then(function(deleted) {\n    // deleted files\n    console.log(deleted)\n  });\n```\n\n## Options\n\nAll methods take an `options` object as the second argument.\n\n### options.force\n\n**Type**: `boolean`\n\n**Default**: `undefined`\n\nBy default, error is thrown if you try to delete either the current working directory itself, or files outside of the current working directory (e.g. parent directories).\n\n**Examples**\n\n```js\ndel.sync('../foo.md', {force: true});\n\ndel('.', {force: true}, function(err, files) {\n  // do stuff with err\n  console.log(files);\n});\n\ndel.promise('./', {force: true})\n  .then(function(files) {\n    console.log(files);\n  })\n```\n\n_(This option was inspired by settings in [grunt](http://gruntjs.com/).)_\n\n## About\n\n### Related projects\n\n* [copy](https://www.npmjs.com/package/copy): Copy files or directories using globs. |
